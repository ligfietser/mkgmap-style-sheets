Welcome to the Free worldwide maps for Garmin brand GPS devices
http://garmin.openstreetmap.nl

The goal of these maps is to advance the OpenStreetMap
project by providing free worldwide Garmin maps based 
upon OpenStreetMap data. I hope that people who appreciate
this website will choose to contribute to the OpenStreetMap
project to improve their own experience and 
make the opensource world map even better.
